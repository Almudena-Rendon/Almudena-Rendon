My name is Almudena, and I'm a multilingual full-stack web developer with a passion for innovative designs.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, MySQL, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind, and I am always learning something new.

I am also passionate about photography and traveling.
