Welcome to Almu Codes' world!

My name is Almudena, and I'm a multilingual full-stack web developer with a passion for innovative designs.

My tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, MySQL, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind, and I am always learning something new.

Beyond tech, I love foreign languagesâ€”I am fluent in Spanish, English, German, and Norwegian.
I am also passionate about photography and traveling.

Please feel free to take a look at my portfolio, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!

Let's connect and explore opportunities together!
